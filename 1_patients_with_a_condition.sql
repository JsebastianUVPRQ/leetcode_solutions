(product_id, start_date, end_date) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the price of the product_id in the period from start_date to end_date.
For each product_id there will be no two overlapping periods. That means there will be no two intersecting periods for the same product_id.
 

Table: UnitsSold

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| product_id    | int     |
| purchase_date | date    |
| units         | int     |
+---------------+---------+
This table may contain duplicate rows.
Each row of this table indicates the date, units, and product_id of each product sold.

Write a solution to find the AVERAGE SELLING PRICE for each product. average_price should be rounded to 2 decimal places.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.
*/
select u.product_id, round(sum(price * units)/sum(units),2) as average_price
from Prices p
right join UnitsSold u
on p.product_id = u.product_id
where purchase_date between start_date and end_date
group by product_id;
